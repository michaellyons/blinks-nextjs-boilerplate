# Blinks Boilerplate Tutorial

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app). This boilerplate sets up a Next.js app with two API endpoints, an `actions.json` in the public folder, and a default page to represent the blink itself.

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

First, clone the repository to your local machine.

### Step 2: Define your blinks endpoints

Our goal is to create two (2) API endpoints.

1. GET endpoint for Blink Metadata (Image, copy, action buttons)
2. POST enpoint for Blink transaction preparation


### Step 3: Define blink page

We need a web page that exists to host an open-graph image that the Phantom app will use to "unfurl" on twitter.
